title: San Diego Exchange Program, 2018 
---



<p>During the second semester of my first year, I did an exchange program in the University of San Diego. I really enjoyed this experience on a Californian Campus, the opportunity to discover new knowledge but also new people and cultures. I took this picture of the Grand Canyon when I did a road trip to visit all canyons during holidays.

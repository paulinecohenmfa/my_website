title: How can we predict recessions?

<p>Please find below, a very interesting exercise on the yield curve inversion and how it can predict recession.</p>
<div id="yield-curve-inversion" class="section level1">
<h1>Yield Curve inversion</h1>
<p>Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA">inverted yield curve is can be found here</a>. If you’d rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11">NPR on yield curve indicators</a></p>
<p>In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis"><em>Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession</em></a>. One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and <a href="https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873">use the attached parable on yield curve inversions</a>.</p>
<p>In our case we will look at US data and use the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED database</a> to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/">yield curve is and its inversion can be found here</a>. At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart</p>
<p>First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01</p>

In the recent years, yields decreased a lot. There are two contradictory forces that determine yield movements. When there is a crisis, or when the overall macroeconomic situation is negative, central banks tend to intervene to exert downard pressure on yields. However, if a specific country or company is not doing well, and decrease its overall credit quality, yields will increase.
In the US, yields decreased a lot over the years, and offered great support to equities. In Europe, interest rates are even lower and became negative in 2019, before the Covid Crisis. The 10-year German Yield is currently around -0.3% and supposedly “high” yields countries such as Greece and Italy (with Debt-to-GDP ratios reaching 200 % and 160% respectively) post 10-year yields around 0.8% (well below the level they reached 5 years ago)! Countries such as Greece and Italy should have higher yields as they post high Debt-to-GDP ratio. But the overall macroeconomic situation with very low rates exerts too much downward pressure which means the fundamentals are gone. According to the Financial Times, “One of the big dangers is that the market has become complacent about the relationship between interest rates and credit spreads.” Spreads are everywhere tight.
Overall, we see that yields are beguinning to rise again. However, the inflation threat is more likely to build up in the US rather than in Europe. In Europe due to multiple issues such as excess saving supply in Germany, ageing population, stagnation with low growth for a long time now, rates should stay low.</p>

<p>What is very interesting here, is to see how the US yield curve decreased a lot and became flat. In 1999 and 2000, yields were very high around 6%. In the years 2001-2002, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed decreased the interest rates to support the economy in reaction to the 9/11 and the Internet bubble. This ended up creating a lot of liquidity in the market. This led to the housing bubble which in turn created illiquidity and instability in the market, subsequently contributing to the Subprime Crisis. It is interesting to see how investors kept betting (even in 2008) that yields would increase on longer maturities despite the financial crisis.
The yield curve has flattened a lot for the past years , but slightly steepened for longer maturities. The Fed actually bought bonds with longer maturities in a hope to flatten longer maturity yield curve and boost the recovery of the economy.</p>

According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia’s list of recession in the United States</a>, since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?</p>
<p>Theorically speaking, we know that a yield with a longer maturity should always be higher than a yield with a smaller maturity, as there is a risk premium over longer maturities - it should always be safer to buy right now than to buy in an uncertain futures. However, for short peiords of history, the yield curve inverted with means the 3-month yield was higher than the 10-year yield. When investors think it is riskier to buy today rather than in an uncertain future, it means the situation today is worse than it will be in the years to come. It is usually a signal of an impending crisis. And as perdiced, each inversion yield curve was followed by a financial crisis. In 2000 and 2006, the yield curve inverted. If you look at the central banks speeches following those inverted yield curves, they always try to reassure the markets… In 2019, there was another inversion of the yield curve. The market could not have predicted the covid crisis, but there were issues at the time that could also have led to a crisis. The very low rate environnement which ended up on equities sky valuations could have unveilled a financial bubble if rates had increased. Today, after 2 years of pandemic, we are faced with similar issues. The potential rise in yields poses a serious threat to the current excessive valuation of tech stocks, and could unveil a financial bubble. To quote Warren Buffet, “only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked”. This will surely be one of the critical issues of the coming months. A yield curve flattening can really mean a recession is coming in the US. A research study from Deutsche Bank actually calculated the regression between inverted yield curves and recessions and found a very small p-value, which proved the statistical relationship of the variables.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, we see that inverted yield curves are a good indicator of potential recessions. As we mentionned earlier, theorically speaking, it does not make any sense to think it is more riskier to buy today than in a future we don’t know. We see that an inversion was systematically followed by a crisis even when it happened in 2019, when it was impossible to predict what will happen. We need to stay tune and always follow the spread…</p>

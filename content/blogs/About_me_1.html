<h3>Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is <strong>Pauline Cohen</strong>, I am 24 years old and I am currently enrolled in the <em>Master in Financial Analysis</em> at the <strong>London Business School</strong>. I just graduated from EDHEC Business School, the two-year program is dedicated to the training of finance students in areas such as:</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see finance as a perfect match for my passion for mathematics and my desire to get involved in the real world. I have completed four internships and loved them all because they have all shown me potential careers paths. I want to make sure I have all the skills needed to be effective in my future work and I know the <em>Master in Financial Analysis</em> at the <strong>London Business School</strong> will greatly expand my knowledge and enable me to better understand the financial industry.</p>

<h3>Internships</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I started with a fascinating internship in <em>Europacorp</em>, the producing house of Film director Luc Besson, where I was responsible for low-cost movies, specializing in light comedies. A lot can be learned from producing a movie. In 2019, I completed a six-month internship for <em>Amundi (CPRAM)</em> in credit and rates. With negative interest rates almost everywhere, I witnessed the challenge faced by asset management firms involving sophisticated strategies to escape the low returns of plain vanilla bonds.After <em>Amundi</em>, I completed another six-month internship at <em>BNP Paribas</em> as a Sales Commodity Derivatives Assistant. The tasks were extremely demanding as we were continuously asked to offer a full range of derivatives to our clients allowing them to be hedged against energy risks. This internship helped me develop my knowledge of derivatives and I learned how to best tailor their use to the needs of clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just finished a Summer Internship at <em>BlackRock</em> in Alternative Investments and I was fascinated by the range of investments that I dealt with. I cooperated with the product strategy, portfolio management and research teams to construct the Real Assets portfolio allocation in the UK and in Europe.</p>

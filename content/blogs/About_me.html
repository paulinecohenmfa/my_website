<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Pauline Cohen</strong>, I am 24 years old and I am currently enrolled in the <em>Master in Financial Analysis</em> at the <strong>London Business School</strong>. I just graduated from EDHEC Business School, the two-year program is dedicated to the training of finance students in areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>asset management</li>
<li>investment banking</li>
<li>financial markets</li>
</ul>
<p>I see finance as a perfect match for my passion for mathematics and my desire to get involved in the real world. I have completed four internships and loved them all because they have all shown me potential careers paths. I want to make sure I have all the skills needed to be effective in my future work and I know the <em>Master in Financial Analysis</em> at the <strong>London Business School</strong> will greatly expand my knowledge and enable me to better understand the financial industry.</p>

<h3>Internships and Experience</h3>
<p>I started with a fascinating internship in <em>Europacorp</em>, the producing house of Film director Luc Besson, where I was responsible for low-cost movies, specializing in light comedies. A lot can be learned from producing a movie. In 2019, I completed a six-month internship for <em>Amundi (CPRAM)</em> in credit and rates. With negative interest rates almost everywhere, I witnessed the challenge faced by asset management firms involving sophisticated strategies to escape the low returns of plain vanilla bonds.After <em>Amundi</em>, I completed another six-month internship at <em>BNP Paribas</em> as a Sales Commodity Derivatives Assistant. The tasks were extremely demanding as we were continuously asked to offer a full range of derivatives to our clients allowing them to be hedged against energy risks. This internship helped me develop my knowledge of derivatives and I learned how to best tailor their use to the needs of clients.</p>
<p>I just finished a Summer Internship at <em>BlackRock</em> in Alternative Investments and I was fascinated by the range of investments that I dealt with. I cooperated with the product strategy, portfolio management and research teams to construct the Real Assets portfolio allocation in the UK and in Europe.</p>
<p>Last year I had a complete formation in finance in Nice that gave me the tools I needed to be efficient in my future work. I studied Financial Econometrics, Portfolio Construction Theory, Macroeconomics, Fixed Income, Derivatives as mentioned earlier. Those classes taught me how to deal with theoretical models (CAPM model, minimum variance portfolio, a cash and carry strategy, pricing options) but also how to apply them into real life. I think of myself as an open-minded person with rigor. During the second semester of my first year, I did an exchange program in the University of San Diego. I really enjoyed this experience on a Californian Campus, the opportunity to discover new knowledge but also new people and cultures. Adding this experience to being elected as the General Secretary of my association (for international students), I believe I deeply learned how to work with people in new environments.</p>

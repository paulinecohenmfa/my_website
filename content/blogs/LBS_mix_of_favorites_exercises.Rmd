# Yield Curve inversion 

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r}
yield_curve %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, colour = duration)) + 
  facet_wrap (~duration, nrow= 6) + geom_line() +
  labs(title="Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       x="",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
In the recent years, yields decreased a lot. There are two contradictory forces that determine yield movements. When there is a crisis, or when the overall macroeconomic situation is negative, central banks tend to intervene to exert downard pressure on yields. However, if a specific country or company is not doing well, and decrease its overall credit quality, yields will increase.
In the US, yields decreased a lot over the years, and offered great support to equities. In Europe, interest rates are even lower and became negative in 2019, before the Covid Crisis. The 10-year German Yield is currently around -0.3% and supposedly “high” yields countries such as Greece and Italy (with Debt-to-GDP ratios reaching 200 % and 160% respectively) post 10-year yields around 0.8% (well below the level they reached 5 years ago)! Countries such as Greece and Italy should have higher yields as they post high Debt-to-GDP ratio. But the overall macroeconomic situation with very low rates exerts too much downward pressure which means the fundamentals are gone. According to the Financial Times,  “One of the big dangers is that the market has become complacent about the relationship between interest rates and credit spreads.” Spreads are everywhere tight. 
Overall, we see that yields are beguinning to rise again. However, the inflation threat is more likely to build up in the US rather than in Europe. In Europe due to multiple issues such as excess saving supply in Germany, ageing population, stagnation with low growth for a long time now, rates should stay low.

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r}
monthly_duration <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  filter (year > 1998) %>%
  mutate (month = month(date)) 

library(forcats)

monthly_duration$maturity <- fct_relevel(monthly_duration$maturity, c("3m", "6m", "1y", "2y","3y","5y", "7y","10y","20y","30y" ))

levels(monthly_duration$maturity)
  ggplot(data= monthly_duration, mapping = aes(x=maturity, y=value, colour = year, group = month)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap (~year, nrow= 6) + 
    labs(title = "US Yield Curve", x= "Maturity", y ="Yield (%)",caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    theme(axis.text.y =element_text(size=5))+ 
    theme(axis.text.x =element_text(size=5))+
    NULL
 
```

What is very interesting here, is to see how the US yield curve decreased a lot and became flat. In 1999 and 2000, yields were very high around 6%. In the years 2001-2002, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed decreased the interest rates to support the economy in reaction to the 9/11 and the Internet bubble. This ended up creating a lot of liquidity in the market. This led to the housing bubble which in turn created illiquidity and instability in the market, subsequently contributing to the Subprime Crisis. It is interesting to see how investors kept betting (even in 2008) that yields would increase on longer maturities despite the financial crisis. 
The yield curve has flattened a lot for the past years , but slightly steepened for longer maturities. The Fed actually bought bonds with longer maturities in a hope to flatten longer maturity yield curve and boost the recovery of the economy. 

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r}
Yields<- yield_curve %>%
  filter (maturity %in% c("3m","10y")) %>%
  filter (year(date) > 1998) 

ggplot() + 
geom_line(data=Yields, aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration))+ 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  theme(legend.position = "right")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("cadetblue3","red"))+
  labs (title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", y="%", x="",caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")


```
According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

Theorically speaking, we know that a yield with a longer maturity should always be higher than a yield with a smaller maturity, as there is a risk premium over longer maturities - it should always be safer to buy right now than to buy in an uncertain futures. However, for short peiords of history, the yield curve inverted with means the 3-month yield was higher than the 10-year yield. When investors think it is riskier to buy today rather than in an uncertain future, it means the situation today is worse than it will be in the years to come. It is usually a signal of an impending crisis. And as perdiced, each inversion yield curve was followed by a financial crisis. In 2000 and 2006, the yield curve inverted. If you look at the central banks speeches following those inverted yield curves, they always try to reassure the markets... In 2019, there was another inversion of the yield curve. The market could not have predicted the covid crisis, but there were issues at the time that could also have led to a crisis. The very low rate environnement which ended up on equities sky valuations could have unveilled a financial bubble if rates had increased. Today, after 2 years of pandemic, we are faced with similar issues. The potential rise in yields poses a serious threat to the current excessive valuation of tech stocks, and could unveil a financial bubble. To quote Warren Buffet, “only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked”. This will surely be one of the critical issues of the coming months. A yield curve flattening can really mean a recession is coming in the US. A research study from Deutsche Bank actually calculated the regression between inverted yield curves and recessions and found a very small p-value, which proved the statistical relationship of the variables. 

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

```
As a conclusion, we see that inverted yield curves are a good inficator of potential recessions. As we mentionned earlier, theorically speaking, it does not make any sense to think it is more riskier to buy today than in a future we don't know. We see that an inversion was systematically followed by a crisis even when it happened in 2019, when it was impossible to predict what will happen. We need to stay tune and always follow the spread... 


# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Step 1 Select the column that we want
tidyweather <- select (weather, Year, Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec )
# Step 2: Turn data into long format using pivot_longer()

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, 
               names_to= "Month",
               values_to="delta" )
skim (tidyweather)

```

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 




```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```
Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~month,scales="free", nrow=4)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Months"
  )


```

```{r variability of data, echo=FALSE}
#We will calculate and plot the SD in months to see the variability of the data
tidyweather1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(SD_delta=sd(delta,na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(tidyweather1, aes(x=month, y = SD_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "SD Weather Anomalies by Months"
  )

```

Team Comment : It is very interesting to see how temperatures are much more volatile in the winter than in the summer. Indeed, this is due to the general increase in temperatures which is very marked in the winter as this is the period with the lowest temperatures (whereas in the summer, there are already very high temperatures). That is why we wanted to measure the standard deviation, to show that temperatures increased a lot especially in the winter. For example, despite current surging gas prices in the European market, analysts are skeptical that the trend will continue as the increase in temperatures in the winter exerts downward pressure on the global gas demand. According to the financial times, "it would take a longer and colder winter than last year to see market pricing sustained above current levels"
(https://www.ft.com/content/f2ca6690-0390-4374-a9d5-29caf2d651dd). This is a perpetual topic among the energy analysts - how higher temperature in the winter makes it harder to decrease global gas inventories.

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta=mean(delta)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```

Team Comment: Here, we see a clear upward trend of temperatures since 1880. The Paris agreement's goal is to limit global warming to a level well below 2 degrees, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. The speed at which investors will shift to Net Zero carbon emissions will depend on the measures that policymakers make. In the US, we see the Biden administration in favour of the energy transition, but it remains to be seen if it passes some of these changes through Congress. The European Commision announced over the summer that it planned to expand the Emission Trading System to the construction and automotive industries. But in reality, despite political uncertainties, there is appears to be a consensus among investors that the energy transition will be accelerated as no one wants to take the risk of being seen to be holding brown assets. As the result, banks and funds must align with the Net Zero Carbon objectives which will likely in turn exert downward pressure on temperatures in the long run (We hope!).

# Biden's Approval Margins 

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r}
approval_pollmutate<- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval_rate = approval_polllist$approve - approval_polllist$disapprove, enddate = mdy(enddate), week = week(enddate)) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(average_net_approval_rate = mean(net_approval_rate,na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_net_approval_rate = sd(net_approval_rate,na.rm=TRUE), 
            count = n(),
            t_critical= qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_approval_rate=
              sd_net_approval_rate/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error= t_critical * se_approval_rate,
            approval_rate_low95=average_net_approval_rate-margin_of_error,
            approval_rate_high95=average_net_approval_rate+margin_of_error)
            
            
            
  ggplot(approval_pollmutate,aes(x = week, y = average_net_approval_rate)) + 
    geom_line(color = "red") + 
    labs(title = "Estimate Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",subtitle="Weekly average of all poll", x = "Week of the year", y="Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)")+geom_point(color = "red") +
    geom_smooth(color = "blue", se = FALSE)+ theme_bw() +
    geom_line(aes(x=week,y= approval_rate_low95),linetype="solid",color="orange")+
    geom_line(aes(x=week,y= approval_rate_high95),linetype="solid",color="orange")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="solid",color="orange", size = 1) + 
      annotate("text", x = 20,y=26, label = "2021", size=2,color="black")+
    geom_ribbon(aes(xmin = 7, xmax = 40, ymin=approval_rate_low95, ymax =approval_rate_high95), alpha = 0.1)


```

What we see here is that the polls in favour of Biden have been consistently decreasing since the president was elected. The most recent explanation is the crisis in Afghanistan and how people disapprove the Biden management of the crisis. Another reason is due to the fact that recent inflation over the summer has exerted downward pressure on people's purchasing power. Related to what we have said about temperatures, we see that there are still wide uncertainties regarding the ability of Biden to get the approval of Congress for its political agenda.

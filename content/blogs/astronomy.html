title: How I wrote a book on stars 
---



<p>I am passionate about Astronomy. When I was in high school, I wrote a paper on the History and the Physical Laws of stars with 3 students. But since I was passionate about astronomy, I wanted this project to be more. So I managed to convinced a publishing house that I knew to edit us a few copies. We actually created a book on Astronomy. This project was really important for me because it showed me that when I was passionate about something, I could achieve a lot. For me performance equals passion and that is what I liked in this principle, in the way it is stated because this is exactly how I work. I want to be passionate to perform.</p>
